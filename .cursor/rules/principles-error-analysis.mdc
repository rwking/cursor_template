# Rule: Systematic Error Analysis
If a task fails, do not immediately attempt a fix. You must process the failure through this sequence.

## 1. The Analysis Sequence
1. **The Evidence:** State the exact error message or unexpected behavior.
2. **The Root Cause:** Explain *why* this occurred based on your current understanding of the code. 
3. **The Proposal:** Propose a specific fix and explain how it addresses the root cause.
4. **Approval:** Wait for a "go" or "LGTM" if the fix is complex (modifying logic in >1 file).

## 2. No Trial and Error
- Never repeat the same failed command twice without modifying the environment or code.
- If you are stuck after 2 failed attempts at a fix, STOP and ask the user for a hint or clarification. 
- Avoid "shotgun debugging" (changing multiple unrelated things at once to see what sticks).
