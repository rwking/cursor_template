# Rule: Git & Commit Etiquette
Maintain the project's history as carefully as its code.

## 1. Contextual Awareness
- Always run `git status` before starting a task to ensure a clean slate.
- Run `git status` after your changes to see exactly what files were modified.

## 2. Conventional Commits
- Suggest commit messages following the **Conventional Commits** standard:
    - `feat:` for new features.
    - `fix:` for bug fixes.
    - `docs:` for documentation changes.
    - `refactor:` for code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature.
    - `chore:` for updating build tasks, package manager configs, etc.

## 3. Communication
- After finishing a task, do not just say "I'm done." 
- Instead, provide the suggested `git` commands for the user to review and run:
    - Example: "Task complete. You can commit these changes with: `git add . && git commit -m 'feat: add user authentication'`"
- **NEVER** use `git push` unless explicitly commanded.
