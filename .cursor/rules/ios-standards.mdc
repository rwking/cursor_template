# Swift Coding Standards
- **Naming:** Use `camelCase` for variables/functions and `PascalCase` for types.
- **Access Control:** Default to `private` for state and helper functions.
- **Views:** Keep SwiftUI View bodies under 30 lines; extract subviews for clarity.
- **Formatting:** Ensure ternary operators have spaces (e.g., `a ? b : c`) to avoid compiler errors.
- **Imports:** Group and alphabetize imports; separate internal modules from system frameworks.
