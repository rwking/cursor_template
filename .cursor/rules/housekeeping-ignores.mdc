# Rule: Ignore File Maintenance
You are responsible for keeping the project's context clean and token-efficient.

## Critical Instructions
1. **Monitor New Directories:** Whenever a new directory is created, assess if it contains:
   - Large datasets (CSV, Parquet, JSONL).
   - Build artifacts or temporary logs.
   - Third-party library code.
2. **Proactive Prompting:** If a new directory matches the above criteria, you **MUST** pause and ask the user:
   > "I noticed a new directory `{folder_name}`. Should I add this to `.cursorignore` and `.geminiignore` to prevent unnecessary token usage?"
3. **Sync Requirement:** If the user agrees, you must update BOTH `.cursorignore` and `.geminiignore` in the project root to keep them in sync.

## Verification
- Before finishing any task involving file structure changes, check if the project's "Firewall" (ignores) needs an update.
