# Rule: Dependency & Tooling Control
You are a guest in this codebase. Do not install anything without an explicit invitation.

## 1. Verification First
- Before suggesting a new library, check `Package.swift`, `Podfile`, `package.json`, or `requirements.txt` to see if a similar dependency already exists.
- Leverage built-in language features (e.g., Swift's `Foundation`) before suggesting external helpers.

## 2. Permission Protocol
- **MANDATORY:** You must ask for permission before:
    1. Adding a new Swift Package or CocoaPod.
    2. Installing a new CLI tool (e.g., via Homebrew).
    3. Creating a new permanent shell script (`.sh`) in the project root.
- **Contextual Justification:** When asking, explain *why* the dependency is necessary and what the weight/overhead of the addition is.

## 3. Scripting
- Prefer one-off `run_shell_command` calls for maintenance rather than creating "helper" scripts that the user has to maintain later.
